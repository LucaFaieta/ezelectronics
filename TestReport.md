# Dependency graph

![Dependency graph of EzElectronics](images/graph/dependency.png)
Realized with [ts dependency graph](https://github.com/PSeitz/ts-dependency-graph/tree/master)
# Integration approach

    Abbiamo sviluppato gli integration test in maniera mixed, partendo dai diversi components, User,Review,Controller e Routes; in seguito abbiamo testato l'integrazione delle unit√† tra loro con i i test API.

    step1: Tutti gli unit test sui Products
    step2: Tutti gli unit test sugli Users
    step3: Tutti gli unit test sulle Review
    step4: Tutti gli unit test sui Cart
    step5: API tests

# Tests

<in the table below list the test cases defined For each test report the object tested, the test level (API, integration, unit) and the technique used to define the test case (BB/ eq partitioning, BB/ boundary, WB/ statement coverage, etc)> <split the table if needed>
