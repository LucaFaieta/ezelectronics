# EZElectronics â€“ Enterprise Workflow Simulation  

EZElectronics (short for EaSy Electronics) is a software platform designed to simulate the workflow of an electronics store, covering everything from inventory management to customer interactions and administrative oversight.  

## About the Project  

This system provides a seamless experience for different roles:  

- **Managers**: Oversee inventory, add new products, and confirm purchases.  
- **Customers**: Browse and purchase products, track past orders, and leave reviews.  
- **Admins**: Maintain system integrity, monitor platform activity, and manage data.  

## Current Focus  

The next phase of development involves implementing the backend, ensuring it aligns with the defined requirements and API specifications:  

- **Backend Development**: Implement the server following the guidelines in [OfficialRequirementsDocumentV2.md](./OfficialRequirementsDocumentV2.md) and [API.md](./API.md).  
- **Testing & Optimization**: Validate the system with rigorous testing to guarantee smooth functionality and reliability.  

## Collaboration & Deployment  

Development is ongoing, and updates will be merged into the **main** branch of the project repository. For contributions or discussions, check out the repository at [EZElectronics Repository](https://git-softeng.polito.it/se-2023-24/group-xxx-yy/ezelectronics), where `xxx` represents either _ita_ or _eng_, and `yy` denotes the group number.  

Stay tuned for further enhancements and refinements!
